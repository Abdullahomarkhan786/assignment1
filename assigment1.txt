## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans)A general-purpose programming language is one that’s usable (not just theoretically, but practically) for solving a very wide range of different kinds of problems.
So, Python, C, JavaScript, Haskell, etc. are general-purpose programming languages. In Python, you can write detailed numerical simulations, web microservices, file format parsers, and so on


Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans)Because type of the variable is determined only during runtime.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans)Pros-
1)Python is easy to learn and read
2)Python enhances productivity
3)Python has a vast collection of libraries
4)Python is free, open-source, and has a vibrant community
Cons-
1)Python can have runtime errors
2)Python consumes a lot of memory space
3)Python is not easy to test

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans)data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Scientific Computing Scripting, Networking, Game Development to Web Development

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans) Variable is name given to memory location
Simply in python declaring a variable with integer datatype-
a=45
Or for string
b=“hello”
Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans) we can take input in java by using input() function it takes input in form of string

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans) String

Q8. What is type casting?
Ans) type casting is concerting one data type to other using the syntax like this
int(input()).  Here we are converting the String datatype to int

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans)no it can take only one input from user, for taking multiple input we can use split()

Q10. What are keywords?
Ans)keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and can't be used for anything but those specific purposes

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans) we cannot use keyword as a variable because they are reserved in python and have a specific meaning

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans) Python indentation refers to adding white space before a statement to a particular block of code.
Indentation is a very important concept of Python because without properly indenting the Python code, you will end up seeing IndentationError and the code will not get compiled.
Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans)by using print Statement we can show some output in python

Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans)arithmetic operators, assignment operators, comparison operators, logical operators, identity operators, membership operators, and boolean operators

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans) / is used for float division and // is used for integer division 

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron

Ans)Code
b="iNeuron"
print(b*4)



Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
Ans)
print("plz enter a number?")
a=int(input())
if a%2==0:
    print("even number")
else:
    print("odd number")


Q18. What are boolean operator?
Ans)Boolean Operators are those that result in the Boolean values of True and False. These include and, or and not. While and & or require 2 operands, not is a unary operator. Boolean operators are most commonly used in arithmetic computations and logical comparisons.

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0
Ans)1

0 and 0
Ans)0

True and False and True
Ans)False

1 or 0 or 0
Ans)1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Ans  3 conditional statements in python are if, else, elif

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans)The if / elif / else structure is a common way to control the flow of a program, allowing you to execute specific blocks of code depending on the value of some data
Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
Ans)
print("enter your age")
age=int(input())
if age>=18:
    print("i can vote")
else:
    print("i can't vote")


Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

Ans)
numbers=[12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
sum=0

for i in numbers:
    if i%2==0:
        sum=sum+i


print(sum)

```


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
Ans)
print("enter 1st number")
a=int(input())
print("enter 2st number")
b=int(input())
print("enter 3st number")
c=int(input())
if a>b:
    if a>c:
        print("a is greatest")
    else:
        print("c is greatest")
else:
    print("b is greatest")




Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans)
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
b=[]
for i in numbers:
    if i>150:
        if i>500:
            break
        continue
    if i%5==0:
        b.append(i)
print(b)
